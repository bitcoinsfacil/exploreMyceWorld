# MYCE WORLD


The blockchain is a digital, decentralized, distributed ledger. Most explanations for it’s importance start with Bitcoin and the history of money. But money is the first use case.  And it is unlikely to be the most important.

Let us inspire:

> Mycelia – the amazing underground networks that are unseen but  sprout up beautiful mushrooms.
> It may be minute, forming a colony that is too small to see, or it may be the largest organism in the world...

Crypto economic systems are new ways of incentivizing human behavior. Their potential is massive.


## IDEA 

> We represent a profit oriented blockchain organization.

A community can coordinate and act as a united group only by aligning their economic goals. A self-sustainable approach with clear objectives: growth for it's members. By making our network bigger and dynamic we connect and empower individual actions.


## IMPLEMENTATION

By providing a simple gateway our ecosystem is cultivating complete interoperability. A two-layer infrastructure that connects blockchain technologies with Internet protocols. 

* An open-source blockchain layer.
* An artificial intelligence powered by bots layer.


We connect blockchains and existing applications with final users. 


## FINANCE


We develop products that simplify and empower the correct use of blockchain technology. In this way MYCE achieves a self-sustainable triangle:


* A cross-chain infrastructure for Business-to-Business interaction.
* A trustless medium of exchange for Business-to-Consumer interaction.  
* A profitable position for the organic growth of MYCE Organization.


MYCE aligns it’s incentives as group by **providing an infrastructure for it's members to build on top**. We incentivize collaborative interactions and continuous open source development.

We are taking advantage of future technologie.
